# PWM Motor Control

## Introduction

In this repository you will find some basic code for controlling typical PWM
motors with popular embedded hardware.  Initially it will be implemented
for the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) to drive motors connected to
an [L239D](http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/l293.pdf) Half-H driver.  Hopefully the
design of the code will make it easy to also support other devices.
