# Simple Demo for PWM Motor Control

The demo can be used as a quick demonstration on how to use
the PWM motor control class.  It can also be used to do
some testing to make sure your electrical setup is working
correctly before attempting to do something more complicated.

The code which interacts with the terminal is largely borrowed
from [ROS's turtlesim teleop_key node](https://github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/blob/melodic-devel/turtlesim/tutorials/teleop_turtle_key.cpp).
